## What is Watcher
Watcher is a cutting-edge security protocol that uses different deep learning models and artificial intelligence to track motor vehicles, criminals, theft and illegal trespassing via a modern CCTV network. We don't simply watch their movements; we also serve as a GPS for the massive network of traffic that passes through our city every day, allowing concerned authorities to keep an eye on these activity through out the city.

This app and web has been submitted as a part of the final presentation given by our team ([Ganesh Prajapati](https://github.com/olivemonk),[Devajit Patar](https://github.com/DevP-ai), [Vandit Tyagin](https://github.com/vandit98) and [Gautam Sarawagi](https://github.com/gautamsarawagi)) in the country's first, one of a unique Hackathon - Ethos organised by IIT Guwahati.
